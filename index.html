      During the quarantine I made cyanotype prints of everyday objects from my
      flat and then transformed them into sea-views using pixel-managing
      algorithms.

      This is an ongoing project, in which I'm exploring the term naive user and
      the behaviours we recognize as default while interacting with various
      devices. The interfaces and patterns we use on a daily basis are
      determined by a very exclusive group of developers and based on specific
      ideologies. This series is an attempt to deconstruct these mechanisms in
      the form of visual narration. Melanie Hoff’s “Digital Love Languages”
      course inspired further thoughts on this topic.

      Big Waves in Unity is the first political entity generated based on the
      regulations of the most popular social media platforms and transcripts of
      interviews with their CEO’s. The starting point was the idea that
      Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are new political (quasi-countries?)
      formations, with their own boundaries, systems of identification and
      methods of punishment. Many users don’t recognize them as such, while
      limiting their functioning on the internet to activity in
      highly-controlled ecosystems. Using the metaphor of politicians and
      elections we are participating in unconsciously, we implemented a markov
      chain algorithm and fed it with official documentation of these social
      networks. BWIU regulary publishes its statements on Twitter and Instagram.
