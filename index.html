<h1 class="h1"> hi! i’m anastasia naumenko, 
artist and programmer based in internet. 
trough my works i try to build intimacy with digital tools i use on daily basis. biggest part of my activity focused on languages and how they 
   influence social codes.
 i use generators and algorythms as an itegral part of creative process. I made a short documentary a few years ago, animation about immigrants identity,
   generated digital landscapes and put some thoughts about users in form of interactive pieces. Together with my friend we bult a first AI political party, 
   which is now manifesting itself through social media platforms.
   Currently im working on web series about computers and generators. Feel free to drop a line on: hello@anastasia-naumenko.com </h1>
