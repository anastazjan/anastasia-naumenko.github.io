artist and programmer based in internet. 
trough my works i try to build intimacy with digital tools i use on daily basis. biggest part of my activity focused on languages and how they 
   influence social codes.
 i use generators and algorythms as an itegral part of creative process. I made a short documentary a few years ago, animation about immigrants identity,
